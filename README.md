# DPM-vs: DPM clustering with variable selection model code #

"sparse_DPM_github.R"
"weibull_probit_DPM_4.R"

"sparse_DPM_github.R" contains the main function DPMvs.MCMC(...) used to perform clustering with variable selection on mixed continuous/discrete variables via a latent variable approach with correlation allowed between infomrative and non-informative variables.  This algorithm is described in the paper "Clustering and Variable Selection in the Presence of Mixed Variable Types and Missing Data" by Storlie, et.al.  Variable inputs and outputs to DPMvs.MCMC(...) are defined at the begining of the function in the begining of the code file.
