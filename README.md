# DPM clustering with variable selection model code #

"sparse_DPM_11.R"

contains the main function DPMvs.MCMC(...) used to perform clustering with variable selection on mixed continuous/discrete variables via a latent variable approach with correlation allowed between infomrative and non-informative variables.  This algorithm is described in the paper "Clustering and Variable Selection in the Presence of Mixed Variable Types and Missing Data" by Storlie, et.al.
